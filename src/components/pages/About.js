        <h1>Synopsis of Meü™û</h1> Currently I'm a Junior Developer with little
        experince frankly. My past jobs and education had nothing to do with
        coding. However, I do have ambition to learn and gain more experience. I
        completed the Southern Methodist University Full-Stack Web Development
        bootcamp. Which was extremely difficult but gave me a good foundation
        for coding. I learned how to read and even write some code. My skills
        shine when dealing with HTML and CSS. Writing JavaScript is still
        challenging for me but I will continue to learn and practice to become
        profecient writing code. Despite my lack of experince, I have
        collaborated with others on group projects that I have completed during
        my bootcamp. I also understand GitHub fairly well. I'm determined to
        better myself not only at writing code, also at bettering myself as a
        person. I want to continue to learn and grow.
