        <h1 className="h1-top">Synopsis of Me🪞</h1> Currently I'm a Junior Developer with little
        experince frankly. My past jobs and education had nothing to do with
        coding. However, I do have ambition to learn and gain more experience. I
        completed the Southern Methodist University Full-Stack Web Development
        bootcamp. Which was extremely difficult but gave me a good foundation
        for coding. I learned how to read and even write some code. My skills
        shine when dealing with HTML and CSS. Writing JavaScript is still
        challenging for me but I will continue to learn and practice to become
        profecient writing code. Despite my lack of experince, I have
        collaborated with others on group projects that I have completed during
        my bootcamp. I also understand GitHub fairly well. I'm determined to
        better myself not only at writing code, also at bettering myself as a
        person. I want to continue to learn and grow.

        <p>
        — I have one year of college education at the University of Houston. I
          plan to enroll at Dallas College in the forseeable future in hopes of
          completing an Associates Degree to further add to my qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
        — I want to become profecient at writing and understanding code. My plan
          to achieve this goal is to watch the recordings of my coding bootcamp
          at SMU, take well-written notes, and practice writing my own code.
