## Professional React Portfolio

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a Professional Portfolio using `React`. To accomplish this, I had to create components, pages, a `app.js`, and `index.js` that all form this single page application. My portfolio has an About Me page where potential employeers can get a sense of who I am as a person. A Resume page where they can see the experience I've had working and information about those jobs. Also included on the Resume page is education I've recieved. I also have a Portfolio page, where I showcase 3 of my group projects, and 3 homework assignments I did on my own. 
## Getting Started
To use this application you'll first want to clone my GitHub Repository to your local computer. Once you open it up, open up the `src folder`, then open up in intergrated terminal on the `idex.js file`. Here you will run `npm i` to install all necessary packages. After this you run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` and the React app should open on your local computer. You can also click the link to the deployed portfolio and view it there.
